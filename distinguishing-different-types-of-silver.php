            <p class="text-indent">Silver: A Popular Precious Metal in Jewelry Industry</p>
            <p class="text-indent">Silver is one of the precious metals widely used in the jewelry industry. It possesses high durability and excellent aesthetics, making it a preferred material for creating beautiful, elegant, and sophisticated jewelry pieces.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">However, when purchasing silver jewelry, we often feel confused by the letters and numbers such as silver 925, silver S925, silver S950, silver S999, Italian silver, Thai silver, and so on, not knowing which one is better and more suitable. To help you understand more about these types of silver, this article will provide detailed information about the most common types of silver on the market today.</p>
            <h2>1. Silver 925</h2>
            <p class="text-indent">Silver 925 is one of the most widely used types of silver in the jewelry industry. It is called silver 925 because it contains 92.5% silver and 7.5% other metals, mainly copper, to increase the hardness and durability of silver. This ratio was established by the British government in the 13th century and is applied to all silver products manufactured in England and Europe. This is the most common ratio used in the production of silver jewelry.</p>

            <h2>2. Silver S925 (Sterling Silver)</h2>
            <p class="text-indent">"Silver S925" can be understood as "Sterling Silver 925," where the letter "S" refers to the first letter of the word "Sterling."</p>
            <p class="text-indent">There is no difference between "silver S925" and "silver 925" in terms of material. Both refer to sterling silver (or silver 92.5%) - a silver-copper alloy, with silver accounting for 92.5% and copper 7.5%.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">Therefore, both terms have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably to refer to sterling silver.</p>

            <h2>3. Silver S950</h2>
            <p class="text-indent">Silver S950 is a higher-grade silver than silver S925 because it contains 95% silver and only 5% other metals. This makes S950 silver have a brighter shine and smoother surface for silver jewelry products.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">However, S950 silver is not a common type of silver and is not widely used in jewelry production. S950 silver products are usually smaller and more expensive than S925 silver products.</p>

            <h2>4. Silver S999</h2>
            <p class="text-indent">Silver S999 is the highest purity silver among silver types. It consists of at least 99.9% silver and only 0.1% other metals. This makes S999 silver very bright and highly shiny, making it an excellent choice for high-end jewelry products.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">However, S999 silver has some limitations in production and use. It is a very soft type of silver and is prone to scratches and dents if not carefully handled. Therefore, S999 silver is often used to produce high-end jewelry products and carefully preserved to maintain the shine and beauty of the product.</p>
