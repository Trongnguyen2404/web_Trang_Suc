            <h2>1. COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY JULY</h2>
            <p class="text-indent">July only collects basic information related to orders, including:...</p>
            <p class="text-indent">These information are used for processing orders, improving service quality, market research, marketing activities, customer care, internal management, or as required by law. Customers can update the provided information at any time to ensure they enjoy all the rights that July offers.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">July commits to:</p>
            <p class="text-indent">- Using customers' personal information for the intended purpose of collection and provision.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">- Seeking customers' consent for all collection and usage of their information.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">- Only using information provided by customers to July, not information obtained through other means.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">- Storing and securing information.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">- Allowing only specific entities to access customer information:</p>
            <p class="text-indent">  - Individuals providing goods or services from July as requested by the customer.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">  - Individuals caring for customers who have used July's goods or services.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">  - Individuals receiving and handling customer inquiries during the use of July's goods or services.</p>

            <h2>2. INFORMATION SECURITY METHODS:</h2>
            <p class="text-indent">Security of the information provided by customers relies on compliance by every July staff member, partner, and data storage system. In case the server storing information is hacked resulting in the loss of customers' personal data, July will promptly notify the relevant authorities for investigation and inform affected customers. However, due to the nature of the internet environment, no data on the network can be 100% secure. Therefore, July does not guarantee absolute security of the information received from customers.</p>
            <h2>3. CUSTOMER INFORMATION SECURITY RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
            <p class="text-indent">Customers are requested to provide accurate and complete information as required by July, especially avoiding providing banking information until encryption of information in online payment transactions or other sensitive information. Customers are fully responsible for the honesty and accuracy of the information provided and bear responsibility if they provide information beyond the requirements.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">In case customers provide their personal information to multiple organizations or individuals, they must request the relevant parties to ensure security. If customers' personal information is disclosed and causes harm, customers must determine the source of the information disclosure. July is not responsible when customers' information is disclosed without reasonable grounds to show that July is the party disclosing the information.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">Customers must not illegally access July's databases or computer systems, endorse intrusion, or disrupt the normal operation of July's website and e-commerce applications. Customers will be held responsible for their unlawful actions.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">Customers are responsible for managing their login accounts on July's websites and e-commerce applications.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">July is not responsible for disclosing customers' information if customers do not comply with the above requirements.</p>
            <h2>4. APPLICABLE LAW IN CASE OF DISPUTE</h2>
            <p class="text-indent">Any disputes between customers and July will be reconciled. If reconciliation fails, disputes will be settled in the competent court and in accordance with Vietnamese law.</p>
